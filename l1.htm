    -- ID - 
    attribute basically ek particular cheeze ko name ya address provide krne ke liye hai
    jisse matlab agar mujhe css ya koi formatting lagani hai woh sirf uss hee particular object 
    par lage, 
    id unique rheta hai

    -- Class - 
    same as ID bas it is not unique isme multiple tags same class me rhe sakte hai 
    id aur class ka naam same ho skta hai kyu ki dono ka selector alag alag hota hai
